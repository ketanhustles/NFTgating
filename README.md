## Features

- NFT Gating: The project enables the implementation of NFT gating, allowing you to restrict access to certain content or features based on NFT ownership.

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kshitijofficial/nftGating.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd nftGating
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both the server and client:

   ```
   cd server && npm install
   cd ../client && npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the project locally, you'll need to start both the server and client. Follow these steps:

1. Start the server:

   ```
   cd server && npm run start
   ```

   This will start the Node.js server.

2. In a separate terminal, start the client:

   ```
   cd client && npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the React.js application using Vite's development server.

3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

4. Customize the project as per your requirements. The code for the server and client can be found in the `server/` and `client/` directories, respectively.

That's it! You can now use this README template as a starting point for your project. Make sure to update the sections with relevant information and instructions specific to your implementation of nftGating. Good luck with your project!
